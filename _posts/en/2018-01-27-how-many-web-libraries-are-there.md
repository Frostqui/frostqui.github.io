## Introduction

The reality is that there are hundrends maybe thousands of web technologies and frameworks for the web develop, counting them it would be impossible cause each short time
appears new technologys. In this article we are going to see the most popular web frameworks to to show yo your best options to choose. Before start is important to
know two concepts: frontend and backend

Frontend is the client side of the website i.e. the look and the things that the user is going to see.
Backend in the other hand, is the server side. Databases and all the logic for the website invisible for the users.

In this post I'll show you the most popular frameworks (for 2018) of both types.

## Frontend technologies

Web Brosers only know HTML, CSS or Javascript languages i.e. the followed frameworks and tools exposed may can be replaced with pure Javascript.  

#### CSS Frameworks 

Alredy created CSS files with predefined styles to help developers. It contains styles and JS code ready to be used as classes in HTML tags to create websites very easy.

- **Bootstrap**: One on the most popular. Nice compatibility with responsive design and good documentation. Recently they released the version (4.0).

- **Foundation**: Good alternative. A lot of flexibility, although difficult to learn.

- **Semantic UI**: The more easy to learn. The name of the predefined classes is easy to learn and anderstand. It's the heaviest file.

#### JS/TS Frameworks 

The most popular and the oldest is Jquery. It serves to write less JS code, so for little projects is good enough. For big projects I personally recommend one 
of the followed frameworks.

- **Angular**: In his first version. AngularJS you have to use JS to use it, but since Angular 2, it uses Typescript, which is a language versy similar to Java.
His performance is a bit lower.

- **React**: Promoted by Facebook. Unlike Angular, React is not a full framework. It has a very large community, with a lot of libreries to extends React.
It has a high learning curve but React fits well in a large web apps.

- **Vue**: One of the most easiest to learn. It can be used to replace Jquery but also for large applications. It has more similarities with AngularJS and React.
The community around this framework has been grown.

- **Ember**: It follows the good practices. Very stable, but also difficult to learn. A long time ago it has been very popular, but with the passage of time, his community has decreased.

#### Task runners

It can be used to program certian task, such as, execute code analyzers each time that a file is saved, compress the files, compile them, etc 

- **Gulp**: One of the most popular nowadays. It uses JS sintax. Faster than Grunt. 

- **Grunt**: A long time ago it has been very popular, but is community has decreased. Uses JSON sintax. For large projects it may be very problematic cause of the length of the files.

- **Webpack**: The most recent. Although, technically is not a task runner, webpack allows to compile and compress a lot of files and dependences to single JS file.

#### Javascript transpilers

We can write code with another language or sintax, and thanks to the transpilers, the code will be transformed to plain JS code:

- **Typescript**: It uses very similar sintax to Java. It has static typing and syntactic sugar. Typescript doesn't have packcage manager, 
- **CoffeScript**: Less used. It adds syntactic abstraccions and more performance to JS, but no adds strong static typing.
- **Babel**: Transpiles ES6 code to ES5. It is very slow and the code transpiled has lower performance.

#### CSS transpilers

Simillary, there are also CSS transpilers to tranform code to CSS, in this case to increase characteristics of CSS:

- **Less**: Easy to learn. The sintax is similar to CSS. It has been writed in Javascript. Very popular and large community. Lees does not support more conditionals.
- **Sass**: Very powerful. It is recommended to use with Ruby. Sass simplify CSS code. To compile code SCSS is necesary to have ruby installed.

## Backend technologies

Unlike the frontend, in the server side, there are more variety of languages to create a server connected to a database. Some of this frameworks can be combined with the frontend technologies.

#### Java

- **Spring**: The most used in this category. You can create a API REST backend or a SOAP based backend. It also offers dependencies inyection.
- **Struts**: It used for business areas. Struts is not a quick library but saves code to programmers.
- **Vaadin**: The less used. Offers the posibility of follows MCV pattern or MVP pattern. It also has UI libraries and component libraries to use.

#### Python

- **Django**: The most popular. You can make servers easy way
- **TurboGears**: Combines several libraries into one library. Extensible.

#### NodeJS

- **ExpressJS**: The most popular. Many libraries start from this library. Does not offer integrations with databases so you will have to use specific libraries to this purpose along with Express.
- **Koa**: Based on ExpressJS but with a minimalistic aproach. Very effective solutions to use asynchronous Javascript code.
- **Sails**: The easiest to use. This library is created to use MVC pattern. By default offers plenty options to integrate databases.

#### Golang

- **Revel**: This library comes with plenty options to create servers, so you don't need to install additional libraries. 
- **Gin**: Minimalistic aproach so maybe you wanna need to install another libraries.
- **Martini**: Is not updated. Slower than Gin, but it comes along with solutions. 
- **Gorilla**: Modularity. All things in this library is a module. so is a perfect solution to large apps.

#### Ruby

- **Rails**: Very easy to use and to learn too. By default comes with several options to integrate all types of databases. Does not scale perfectly for large websites.

## Conclusion

As you can see there are a lot of frameworks, tools, and libraries to create websites, but there are a lot more out there. Choosing one or another depends of the tastes of each one and the 
size of the project. The web area is evolving continuosly, that means, that a library that is the most popular today, maybe, tomorrow not, that's why you have to have an open mind to adapt to market changes.
